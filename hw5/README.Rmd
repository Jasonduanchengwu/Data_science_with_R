This is another instruction readme to show the entire workflow I did for the homework.
Since I have a computational limited machine, I had to break up the homework into
multiple sections and save multiple files and .rds

You should start with the hw5OverallSol file which contains my instructions for
how I did this assignment. 

Then it would be in the sequence of "hw5Preprocess.qmd", "hw5Enet.qmd", 
"hw5Boosting.qmd", "hw5Mlp.qmd", "hw5Stack.qmd" and back to "hw5OverallSol.qmd"
for a table summary of the performances of all the models.

Have a great day!
